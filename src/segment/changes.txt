1. setup testing environment
2. removed need for borders.  also removed a potential bug that may cause problems:  if x ==0 or x == sx-1, neighbors are not inspected correctly.
3. [ix][ty] is probably not useful - ty is accessed in parallel.  so for each iteration of ix, actually want ty to be as the inner loop.



4. bank conflict
5. use of T* (local memory?) - switch to shared...
6. reduce register usage (maybe by removing the use of DevMem2D?)
