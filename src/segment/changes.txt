1. setup testing environment
2. removed need for borders.  also removed a potential bug that may cause problems:  if x ==0 or x == sx-1, neighbors are not inspected correctly.
3. [ix][ty] is probably not useful - ty is accessed in parallel.  so for each iteration of ix, actually want ty to be as the inner loop.


4. debug imrecon-int code. - binary version works.  why does int version not?
	4.1 - check all image tests as binary and as int. - definitely have a problem when it's int.
	4.2 - test the x and y separately.  problem is with x.
	4.3 - was calling forward and backward x2 with thread block set up for x.
	
5. bank conflict
6. use of T* (local memory?) - switch to shared...
7. reduce register usage (maybe by removing the use of DevMem2D?)
